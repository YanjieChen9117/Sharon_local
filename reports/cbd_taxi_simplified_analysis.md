## Data Description

- **Dataset:** Hourly aggregated NYC Yellow & Green Taxi data (weighted combination)
- **Time Period:** 2023-01-01 to 2025-08-31
- **Total Observations:** 23,373 hours
- **Pre-policy Period:** 17,638 hours
- **Post-policy Period:** 5,735 hours
- **Yellow Taxi Proportion:** 97.96%
- **Green Taxi Proportion:** 2.04%

## Methodology

### 1. Data Aggregation
Yellow and Green taxi data are combined using weighted averaging:
- **Sum metrics** (total_trips, total_revenue): Direct summation
- **Average metrics** (avg_speed, avg_distance, etc.): Weighted by total_trips
- **Ratio metrics** (cbd_inside_ratio, etc.): Weighted by total_trips

This ensures that taxi types with more trips have proportionally more influence on the combined metrics.

### 2. Descriptive Analysis
- Simple before/after comparisons using t-tests
- Peak vs off-peak hour analysis
- Statistical significance testing at Î± = 0.05

### 3. Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis

#### 3.1 DiD Methodology Overview

The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method estimates the causal effect of a policy by comparing the change in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. The analysis employs a regression-based framework to estimate the average treatment effect.

**Regression-Based DiD Model:**

The DiD estimator is implemented through the following linear regression specification:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta D_i + \gamma Post_t + \delta (D_i \times Post_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $Y_{it}$ = Outcome variable for observation $i$ at time $t$
- $D_i$ = Treatment indicator (1 if observation $i$ belongs to treatment group, 0 otherwise)
- $Post_t$ = Time indicator (1 if time $t$ is post-policy period, 0 otherwise)
- $\alpha$ = Constant term (baseline outcome for control group in pre-policy period)
- $\beta$ = Treatment group fixed effect (difference between treatment and control groups in pre-policy period)
- $\gamma$ = Time fixed effect (common time trend affecting both groups)
- $\delta$ = Average treatment effect (the DiD estimator)
- $\epsilon_{it}$ = Error term

The coefficient $\delta$ represents the average treatment effect, capturing the differential impact of the policy on the treatment group relative to the control group, net of any common time trends. This formulation is equivalent to the traditional DiD formula when there are only two groups and two periods, but provides greater flexibility for incorporating additional controls and extending to multiple periods.

**Key Assumption:** The parallel trends assumption requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the difference between treatment and control groups would remain constant over time.

#### 3.2 DiD Implementation in This Analysis

**Analysis 1: Peak vs Off-Peak Hours**

The regression specification for peak hour analysis is:

$$
\text{Speed}_{it} = \alpha + \beta \text{Peak}_i + \gamma \text{Post}_t + \delta (\text{Peak}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $\text{Speed}_{it}$ = Average speed for hour $i$ at time $t$
- $\text{Peak}_i$ = Binary indicator for peak hours (1 if 7-10 AM or 4-7 PM, 0 otherwise)
- $\text{Post}_t$ = Binary indicator for post-policy period
- $\delta$ = Treatment effect of congestion pricing on peak hour speeds

**Result:** $\hat{\delta} = -0.0598$ mph (peak hour differential impact)

**Analysis 2: CBD Exposure**

The regression specification for CBD exposure analysis is:

$$
\text{Speed}_{it} = \alpha + \beta \text{HighCBD}_i + \gamma \text{Post}_t + \delta (\text{HighCBD}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $\text{Speed}_{it}$ = Average speed for hour $i$ at time $t$
- $\text{HighCBD}_i$ = Binary indicator for high CBD exposure (1 if above median CBD interaction, 0 otherwise)
- $\text{Post}_t$ = Binary indicator for post-policy period
- $\delta$ = Treatment effect of congestion pricing on high CBD exposure areas

**Result:** $\hat{\delta} = -0.7958$ mph (CBD exposure differential impact)

#### 3.3 Discussion: Equal Sample Size Requirement

**Professor's Concern:** "DiD requires equal number of observations in pre- and post-policy periods."

**Evaluation:**

1. **Theoretical Requirement:** DiD does NOT strictly require equal sample sizes. The method is valid as long as:
   - The parallel trends assumption holds
   - Both periods have sufficient observations for reliable estimation
   - Standard errors are properly calculated

2. **Our Data:**
   - Pre-policy: 17,638 hours
   - Post-policy: 5,735 hours
   - Ratio: 3.08:1

3. **Implications:**
   - **Unequal sample sizes are acceptable** in DiD analysis
   - Larger pre-policy sample provides better baseline estimation
   - Standard t-tests and regression-based DiD handle unequal samples naturally
   - **Concern:** If sample sizes are very imbalanced, statistical power may be reduced
   - **Mitigation:** We have substantial observations in both periods (5,000+ hours each)

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Use regression-based DiD for formal inference: $Y_{it} = \beta_0 + sample sizes and provides standard errors
   - Consider time-var\beta_1 \text{Post}_t + \beta_2 \text{Treatment}_i + \beta_3 (\text{Post}_t \times \text{Treatment}_i) + \epsilon_{it}$
   - Where $\beta_3$ is the DiD estimate
   - This approach properly accounts for unequal ying confounders and seasonality

**Conclusion:** The equal sample size "requirement" is a misconception. Our analysis is methodologically sound with unequal sample sizes.

## Policy Impact Assessment

### Speed Effects
The analysis shows no statistically significant changes in average speeds following the CBD congestion pricing implementation. The overall speed change was -0.64%.

### CBD Usage Patterns
CBD internal trip ratios show a increase of 1.89%, which is statistically significant.

### Trip Volume Effects
Overall taxi trip volumes decreased by 3.19%, suggesting demand reduction.

### Substitution Effect Analysis (CBD Neighbor Areas)

To detect whether passengers are avoiding the congestion charge by using neighboring areas instead of CBD:

**CBD Neighbor In Ratio (trips entering CBD neighbor areas):**
- Change: +1.22%
- Statistical significance: Significant (p = 0.0009)

**CBD Neighbor Out Ratio (trips leaving CBD neighbor areas):**
- Change: -0.84%
- Statistical significance: Not significant (p = 0.1192)

**Interpretation:**
There is evidence of a substitution effect. Passengers appear to be avoiding the CBD congestion charge by shifting their trips to neighboring areas. This suggests the policy is having its intended deterrent effect on CBD usage, but may be displacing congestion to adjacent areas.

## Difference-in-Differences Results

1. **Peak Hours Effect:** -0.0598 mph differential impact during peak hours
2. **CBD Exposure Effect:** -0.7958 mph differential impact for high CBD exposure areas

## Conclusions

Based on the comprehensive analysis of NYC Yellow & Green Taxi hourly data:

1. **Speed Effects:** No evidence of speed improvements following policy implementation
2. **Usage Patterns:** No evidence of reduced CBD usage as intended by the policy
3. **Substitution Effect:** Evidence suggests passengers are avoiding CBD by using neighboring areas
4. **Overall Impact:** The policy shows mixed results in the initial implementation period

## Limitations

1. **Simplified Analysis:** This analysis uses basic statistical methods and may not capture complex causal relationships
2. **Confounding Factors:** Weather, holidays, and other concurrent changes not controlled for
3. **Short-term Data:** Limited post-policy observation period (approximately 8 months)
4. **Data Scope:** Only Yellow & Green Taxi data, excluding other transportation modes (Uber, Lyft, public transit, private vehicles)
5. **Parallel Trends Assumption:** DiD assumes parallel trends, which we have not formally tested
6. **Seasonality:** Monthly and seasonal patterns may confound the policy effect
